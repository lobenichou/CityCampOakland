# Data Visualization Workshop with Mapbox GL JS

### Workshop + Skills

Participants in this workshop learn how to use Mapbox to create a map visualizing the geographic and ethnic distribution of Police Stops in Oakland in 2015. 90 mins.

To build the map visualization, participants use Mapbox to:
* import shapefiles
* join data tables (police stops + police beats)
* apply custom map styles (from Mapbox Studio)
* use data-driven styling (color + extrusions)

Then, participants learn how to make the map interactive by adding user controls so the viewer can toggle the display, showing data by race: `Afr American`, `Asian`, `White,Hispanic`, `Other` or `All`.
